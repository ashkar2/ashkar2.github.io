This page is about my favorite musical artist, <a href="https://www.macmillerswebsite.com/"<em>Mac Miller...</em></a>
</p>
<div class="first"> 
   <p> 
   <span>Mac Miller began his debut as a hip hop music artist at the age of 18 with his mixtapes <em>K.I.D.S</em> & <em>Best Day Ever.</em>  His top songs include <em> Kool Aid and Frozen Pizza, Best Day Ever, Self Care, Come Back to Earth, and Good News.</em> In 2018, due to struggle with substance, Mac Miller unfortunately passed away. Although Miller's career was short lived, his music explored a new perspective on the hip hop industry and was popular among many audiences.</span>
   </p>   
   
   <p>
   <span>While Mac Miller's albums are all unique in their own way, my personal favorite would be his <em>K.I.D.S</em> album - in particular <strong>The Spins. The Spins</strong> definitely gives me a nostalgic vibe reminding me about high school or hanging out with friends during the summer. The song has a stead drum beat with occasional keyboard riffs.</span>
